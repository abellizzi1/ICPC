# ICPC
### A website created for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) team at Iowa State.
This was my senior group project at Iowa State. It uses Typescript, the frontend uses React, and the backend uses MySQL, Node, Express, and Prisma as a Object Relational Mapper (ORM). Both the frontend and backend also use Jest for testing.

This website accomplishes the following things:
- Tracks students' progress over time
- Gives the admins and head coaches the ability to add, edit, and remove students, teams, problems, categories, and difficulties within their organization
- Gives anyone the ability to create and join a team
- Ranks individuals within teams and organizations based on skill level
- Displays statistics for each individual based on the amount of programming problems they've compelted and their ranking in Codeforces, Leetcode, and Uhunt

Since this was a group project, I did not create the whole thing. I created many endpoints and service methods in the backend, and I also created a lot of the pages in the frontend. List of pages I had major contributions to:
- CreateTeamPage
- DashboardPage
- GraduatedArchivePage
- ManageProblemsPage
- ManageTeamsPage
- ManageUsersPage
- ProblemsPage
- UserInfoPage
- UserStatsPage
- ViewProblemPage
