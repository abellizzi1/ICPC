# ICPC
### A website created for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) team at Iowa State.
This was my senior group project at Iowa State. It uses Typescript, the frontend uses React, and the backend uses MySQL, Node, Express, and Prisma as a Object Relational Mapper (ORM). Both the frontend and backend also use Jest for testing.

Since this was a group project, I did not create the whole thing. I created many endpoints and service methods in the backend, and I also created a lot of the pages in the frontend. List of pages I had major contributions to:
- CreateTeamPage
- DashboardPage
- GraduatedArchivePage
- ManageProblemsPage
- ManageTeamsPage
- ManageUsersPage
- ProblemsPage
- UserInfoPage
- UserStatsPage
- ViewProblemPage
